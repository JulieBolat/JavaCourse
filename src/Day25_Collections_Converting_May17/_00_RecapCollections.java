    /*
               Array vs ArrayList
    -ArrayList is resizable, Array is fixed-sized
    -Array can store both primitive and reference,
    -Use length in Array, size method in ArrayList
    -Both can duplicate elements
    -Both use insertion order

               ArrayList vs Set
     -Set is unordered, ArrayList uses insertion order
     -Set does not allow duplicate values, ArrayList allows duplicates

               TreeSet
     -It is an ordered set (using natural order-ascending order)

               LinkedHashSet
     -It is using insertion order

               HashSet
     -Unordered set

     ***We cannot use get method with Sets!!!
