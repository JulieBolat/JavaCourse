    //Method: A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
    // You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
    // Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

    //Method Overloading: In Java, two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameters..

    /* Interview Question
          Array VS ArrayList
    Major difference is that; Array is a fixed length data structure,
    so we can't change length of Array once created, ArrayList is resizable.

    The other major one is that Array can contain both primitives and objects.
    ArrayList can only contain objects. It cannot contain primitive types.

    Also, we can compare Array and ArrayList on how to calculate
    length of Array or size of ArrayList.
    We use length for an Array, we use size() method for an ArrayList.
